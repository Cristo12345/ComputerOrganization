# ComputerOrganization
Various projects and labs I have worked on during my time in Professor Izidor Gertner's Computer Architecture &amp; Organization class (CS 342 &amp; 343) during the Fall 2019 Semester at the City College of New York

<b>DISLCAIMER:</b> Some of these projects use a 7 Segment Decoder file to output hexadecimal numbers on the Altera board's display. This file was written by classmate <a href="https://github.com/ayushyamitabh">Ayushya Amitabh</a>. I do not claim ownership of this file. 


## Mini ALU
In this lab, I designed a miniature Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) using VHDL. The ALU is one of the most crucial components of a CPU and is responsible for performing arithmetic and logic operations. After creating several components in VHDL, I mounted the design onto an Altera DE2 board using Intel's Quartus software. A demo of the design is provided in the video.
